# Keylogger
Python Keylogger

A keylogger, or keystroke logger, is a type of malware or hardware that records keystrokes typed on a computer or other input device. Keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, such as software development feedback, but they are often used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and web pages visited.

This is a python code for a keylogger. upon running this,all the information typed on the keyboard will be stored into the file which will be easy access to the hackers.(sensitive information like mails,account passwords etc.)
I reccomend to view this as a learning oppurtunity and not to go against the community guidelines.
Happy learning!
