Python Keylogger

A keylogger, or keystroke logger, is a type of malware or hardware that records keystrokes typed on a computer or other input device. Keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, such as software development feedback, but they are often used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and web pages visited.
